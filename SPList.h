/**
 * List Container
 *
 * Implements a list container type.
 * The list has an internal iterator for external use. For all functions
 * where the state of the iterator after calling that function is not stated,
 * the state of the iterator is undefined. That is you cannot assume anything about it.
 *
 * The following functions are available:
 *
 *   listCreate               - Creates a new empty list
 *   listDestroy              - Deletes an existing list and frees all resources
 *   listCopy                 - Copies an existing list
 *   listSize                 - Returns the size of a given list
 *   listFirst                - Sets the internal iterator to the first element
 *                              in the list, and returns it.
 *   listNext                 - Advances the internal iterator to the next
 *                              element and returns it.
 *   listInsertFirst          - Inserts an element in the beginning of the list
 *   listInsertLast           - Inserts an element in the end of the list
 *   listInsertBeforeCurrent  - Inserts an element right before the place of
 *                              internal iterator
 *   listInsertAfterCurrent   - Inserts an element right after the place of the
 *                              internal iterator
 *   listRemoveCurrent        - Removes the element pointed by the internal
 *                              iterator
 *   listGetCurrent           - Return the current element (pointed by the
 *                              internal iterator)
 *   listGetFirst             - Sets the internal iterator (also called current
 *                              element) to be the first element in the list and
 *                              return it.
 *   listGetNext              - Advances the list's iterator to the next element
 *                              and return it
 *   listClear		      	  - Clears all the data from the list
